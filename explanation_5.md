TrieNode.__init__ takes constant time and space.
TrieNode.insert takes O(1) for time and space.

Trie.__init__ takes constant time and space.
The method Trie.find() traverses through the prefix String with a for loop and searches through the levels of the Trie until the last character of prefix und returns the corresponding dictionary.
The time complexity of find() is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).

Trie.insert traverses through the prefix String with a for loop  if the new word is in the root as part of the saved words and sets the new 'word ends'.
Also insert the new chars to the root with TrieNode.insert.
The time complexity for traversing the word is O(word) and Space complexity is O(n) for adding new entries to the dict.

TrieNode.suffixes() method appends all possible suffixes of the given
node to a set. The set is the optimal data structure as all word or suffixes are unique for the prefix,also inserting is faster then with lists.
The time complexity is O(n) given with the get_suffixes method that combines a loop with a recursive approach to traverse all the dicts 'n' in the prefix TrieNode . Space complexity is O(n) for all n possible suffixes equal to the dicts in root.children.

The overall time complexity is O(n) for traversing the TrieNode (n = number of dicts) same as the space complexity because of the dict data structure.
