By traversing the list and finding a 0 it switches places with the first entry in the list and increasing the index of the first entry by one.
The same way it works for finding a 2 with the last value and decreasing the index of the last value by one.
Time complexity is O(n).
Space complexity is O(1) because of using only the given list.
