The values are maxed out if the biggest numbers are at the starting digits of each of the created numbers.
So the array is sorted by mergesort and adding the elements every iteration to the left or the right value.
Because of mergesort the time complexity is O(n log(n))
Space complexity is constant given by the array with 2 elements O(1).
